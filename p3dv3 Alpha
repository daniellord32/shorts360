Alpha version of the Shorts-360 aircraft, I have only tested with P3D v3, I have not tested with other versions.

Please note this is an Alpha version, alot of things have not been implemented and some gauges are either not displaying or are not displaying correct information.

Other then that it does fly and the majority of animations are currently working.

error list:
ensure you have ms C++ re-distributal, I initially started the project using vs2008. I am not sure of the version needed at this time but will provide a link
to the correct one once I have found out which version is required.
