This is my final year project based on the Shorts 360 aircraft developed by Shorts Belfast.

The project is still WIP and is expected to be completed by Summer 2018. Currently the aircraft is flyable and some of the bugs at this stage are known (see below).

*Known bugs*
1. Voltmeter jumping - Not reading voltage correctly from built-in model.XML (fix being tested).
2. Prop RPM Needle- data not being displayed correctly (fix being tested).
3. General gauge orientation (will be corrected at end of project).
4. Incorrect animation of levers in Virtual cockpit. (Low priority will be fixed at end of project).

I am not artistic, if anyone wishes to contribute to the project your paricipitation will be greatly appreciated.
